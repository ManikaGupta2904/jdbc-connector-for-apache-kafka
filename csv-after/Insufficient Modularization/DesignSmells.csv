Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceConnectorConfigTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because cleanup is more interested in members of the type: EmbeddedDerby
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskConversionTest,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: extendedMapping
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskLifecycleTest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): JdbcSourceTaskTestBase
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskUpdateTest,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskUpdateTest.Field,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskUpdateTest.Field,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,TableMonitorThreadTest,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)

Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: POLL_INTERVAL; FOO; BAR; BAZ; QUAL; DUP1; DUP2; LIST_EMPTY; LIST_FOO; LIST_FOO_BAR; LIST_FOO_BAR_BAZ; LIST_DUP_ONLY; LIST_DUP_WITH_ALL; FIRST_TOPIC_LIST; VIEW_TOPIC_LIST; SECOND_TOPIC_LIST; THIRD_TOPIC_LIST; DEFAULT_TABLE_TYPES; VIEW_TABLE_TYPES; tableMonitorThread; connectionProvider; connection; dialect; context
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,TableMonitorThreadTest.Op,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,JdbcSourceTaskTestBase,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because tearDown is more interested in members of the type: EmbeddedDerby
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.CaseSensitive,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: name
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.CaseSensitive,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.TableName,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.TableName,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.ColumnName,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.ColumnName,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.Condition,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
jdbc,io.aiven.connect.jdbc.source,EmbeddedDerby.Condition,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
